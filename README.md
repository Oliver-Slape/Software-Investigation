# Software Investigation

## Introduction 
### In this 2D web application game, the player(s) will participate in four educational mini games to help save the world whilst learning about the effects of greenhouse gases on the world. The app also provides a closer look at the greenhouse gases timeline for four products; mobile phones, beef, leaving electronic devices on standby and plastic bottles.

## User requirements 
### ZSL Whipsnade and London Zoo require an app to be created for 11-16-year-old school students. The students will use the app during a ‘Climate Change and Animals’ session, which will be delivered at both Zoos.

### In the app, school students will construct a greenhouse gas chain (like a food chain). This chain will follow the ‘greenhouse gas footprint’ of four different products, from their production to their disposal (a mobile phone, beef, a plastic bottle and electronics left on standby). As the chain forms, the greenhouse gas footprint (how many greenhouse gases are emitted) could visually add up. Once the chain is fully constructed, students will be able to explore actions they could take to help reduce the ‘greenhouse gas footprint’ of each product. Remember these actions need to be applicable for 11-16 year olds! (E.g. unplug their mobile phone charger once the device is fully charged.)

### The app will be used on iPads during the schools’ session at the Zoo, but in the future, it could be used by people on their own devices. To accommodate for all scenarios, the app must be a website with an app-interface.

### The app should be educational, but also fun and interactive.

### The following is the ‘greenhouse gas footprint’ of four different products, from their production to their disposal. The numbers below represent the order of the stages for each greenhouse gas chain.

## Beef

### (1) Carbon released as trees and plants are cut down to make space for cows and to grow their feed.
### (2-6 – the exact order between 2-6 doesn’t matter) Carbon released from pesticides that are put on cow feed to stop them being damaged by pests. Also, a lot of carbon is released when electricity is generated to produce pesticides. 
### (2-6 – the exact order between 2-6 doesn’t matter) Carbon and nitrous oxide released from fertilisers that are used to help cow feed grow. Also, a lot of carbon is released when electricity is generated to produce pesticides. Interesting fact to possibly include: nitrous oxide is 300 times more harmful to the environment than carbon.
### (2-6 – the exact order between 2-6 doesn’t matter) Carbon released when electricity pumps water from underground/rivers/reservoirs/streams/canals to provide drink for the cows and to water their feed in the fields.
### (2-6 – the exact order between 2-6 doesn’t matter) Carbon released when farm vehicles and machinery are used on the farm and fields.
### (2-6– the exact order between 2-6 doesn’t matter) Methane released when grazing cows pass wind. Interesting fact to possibly include: methane is 23 times more harmful to the environment than carbon.
### (7) Carbon released when animals are transported to the slaughter house.
### (8) Carbon released as electricity powers fridges, lights, computers, water and many more resources in the slaughter house.
### (9) Carbon released from the production of the materials used to package the beef.
### (10) Carbon released when beef is transported to the shops and restaurants it is sold in. Sometimes it is flown over from a different country!
### (11) Carbon released as electricity powers fridges, lights, computers, heating, water and many more resources in the shops and restaurants. 
### (12) Carbon released as customers travel to the shops and restaurants.
### (13) Methane released as beef and packaging decomposes in landfill.

## Plastic bottle
### (1) Carbon released as drilling rigs are constructed, installed and run. 
### (2) Carbon released as oil is transported via pipes/ships to treatment plants.
### (3) Carbon released as electricity is required to clean the oil.
### (4) Carbon released as oil is transported via pipes/ships/rail/tankers to manufacturers.
### (5) Carbon released when electricity is generated to form the oil into plastic bottles and lids.
### (6) Carbon released as empty bottles are transported to a bottling plant.
### (7) Carbon released when machinery fills bottles with drink. 
### (8) Carbon released when bottles are packaged.
### (9) Carbon released as plastic bottles are transported to shops and restaurants.
### (10) Carbon released as electricity powers fridges, lights, computers, heating, water and many more resources in the shops and restaurants. 
### (11) Carbon released as customers travel to the shops and restaurants.
### (12) Methane released as plastic bottle decomposes in landfill. Interesting fact to possibly include: methane is 23 times more harmful to the environment than carbon.


## Electronics left on standby
### (1) Carbon released when natural gas drilling rigs are constructed, installed and run.
### (2) Carbon released as natural gas is transported via pipes/ships/tankers to treatment plants.
### (3) Carbon released as electricity is required to clean and dry the natural gas. 
### (4) Carbon released when natural gas is odorised so people can smell it and be alerted to a gas leak.
### (5) Carbon released as natural gas is transported via pipes/ships/tankers to power stations in the UK. (Interesting fact to possibly include: In the UK natural gas has almost run out it is imported from further away now!)
### (6) Carbon released when natural gas is burned in power stations to drive turbines, which then produces electricity.
### (7) Carbon released as electricity is needed for pylons/powerlines to carry electricity. (Interesting fact to possibly include: 10% of electricity wasted along metal pylons!)
### (8) 15kg of carbon waster per year leaving TV on standby. (Interesting fact to possibly include: 9-16% of the electricity consumed in homes is used to power appliances when they are in this standby mode.)

## Mobile phone
### (1) Carbon released as oil drilling rigs and mines are constructed, installed and run to extract raw materials which mostly come from rainforests. (Is there a way of highlighting that mining takes place in and destroys rainforests?)
### (2) Carbon released as raw materials are transported to factories in China, Taiwan, Japan or Korea. 
### (3) Carbon released when electricity is generated to construct raw materials into usable phone parts. 
### (4) Carbon released when mobile phones are packaged.
### (5) Carbon released as constructed mobile phones are transported to the phone shop.
### (6) Carbon released as electricity powers lights, computers, heating, water and many more resources in the phone shop. 
### (7) Carbon released as customers travel to the phone shop.
### (8) Carbon released when electricity is used every time the phone is charged.
### (9) Carbon released as raw materials continue to be drilled/mined if phone is not recycled. Interesting fact to possibly include: 80% of the carbon footprint of a phone happened before it’s turned on for the first time!

## Objective of the Game

### The objective of the game is to restore the map of the world, and reduce the greenhouse gas meter from red to green by participating in each of the four mini games.

#### Mini game 1: British Countryside – Beef
#### A Snake style maze game in which the player must move their character to eat the vegetables and avoid the beef.

#### Mini game 2: Ocean – Plastic Bottles
#### A basketball style game in which the player must throw plastic bottles into the recycling bin.

#### Mini game 3: Rainforest – Mobile Phone
#### A collection style game in which working mobile phones, and broken mobile phones fall from the top of the screen where the player must catch the broken phones in the recycling bin, and working phones into the backpack.

#### Mini game 4: Arctic – Leaving electronic devices on standby
#### A game in which players must unplug and turn off switches for electronic devices.

### Meeting Requirements
#### We translated the requirements set out by the client into Epics and User stories. This is part of the Agile Scrum project framework. The Epics are large requirements that can’t be divided into singular tasks. These are then split into user stories. These are descriptions of a feature from the user’s perspective. They generally follow this structure “As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >. ".

### For Example:
#### An epic would be to teach about the greenhouse gasses.
#### This was put into user stories as such;
##### As a game player, I want to see the greenhouse gas timeline for mobile phones, beef, plastic bottles and leaving devices on standby so that I can learn about each stage
##### As a game player, I want to learn what I can do to help minimise greenhouse gases so that I can implement these actions in my everyday life.

##### We used Google Drive to collaborate on documentation and to store our image assets and create presentations for client meetings. 
##### We used Shutter stock to source images and assets we weren’t creating ourselves. 
##### We used Unity as our main development platform. This also included using Visual Studio as they work in unison. 
##### We used a variety of image editors including Photoshop and Illustrator. 

#### Techniques
##### We used a variety of techniques for this project. Some of these are; 
##### Communication in meeting with the client. 
##### Time management in setting deadlines and a burn down chart. 
##### Evaluation and feedback in prototyping and testing. 
##### Creativity and decision making in design.

## First Client Meeting (2nd OCT 2017)
